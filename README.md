    Incident Response Plans
	It is common practice to have an incident response plan ready for a cyber attack, it seems to be not if but when an 
 
attacker will gain unwanted access. Even the biggest companies fail to these attacks for example one of the largest 
 
retailers in North America Target, fell victim to a data breach in 2013. According to Red River, "hackers were able to steal

40 million credit and debit records." Attackers could gain unwanted access to Target systems pretending to be a 3rd party 

vendor Target was using.

The first step in all incident response plans is preparation and it seems Target didn't prepare all too well. According to 

Cover Link "This large-scale breach could have been minimized or potentially avoided altogether if Target had additional cybersecurity precautions in place" This means that if Target had spent more on things like better encryption methods they 

possibly could have avoided paying out 18 million dollars for a settlement. Target was in a vulnerable state to begin with. 

Several warnings were overlooked by Target and they took no action. So if Target had a better operations center with better 

training they could have stopped the attack before it was too late.

As you can see target missed the first few vital steps in an incident response plan, they failed to prepare and they failed

to identify when they received alerts about a possible breach. The company did not act until the government got involved 

resulting in them implementing new security measures. 	

It seems after Target had the threats investigated and eradicated they may have learned something from the incident by 

increasing their security measure exponentially. They hired another 3rd party company to encrypt card information for them

as well as enforced new employee password policies. Before the incident, another vulnerability they had was poorly 

segregated networks so they segmented their networks but only after the incident had occurred. All of these resulted in 

major damages to the company's reputation as well as they paid 18 million in legal fees.

Companies can learn from targets' mistakes and I'm sure they have. This was pretty much the worst-case scenario were target

didn't do just about anything at all to enforce cyber security but it does display what can go wrong if you don't enforce 

standard security measures.
